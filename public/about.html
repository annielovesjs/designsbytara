                <p>I have been designing costumes, apparel, accessories, evening wear, and full haute couture gowns since my graduation from the School Of Fashion and Design at Ryerson University. </br></br> I love nothing more than working with a client and getting to know their goals for what they want me to create. Taking their imagination, I can transform the images and ideas in their head into the finished glamorous outfits or costumes I have been designing and making for over 15 years. From the initial sketches to create the image of the final goal, to sourcing the fabrics and accessories, to cutting and sewing the full final garment, I am the creator and producer from start to finish in my studio. Seeing the happiness on my clients faces as they wear our collaborative creations is my ultimate satisfaction.</p>
